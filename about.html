      <h1>why we built wakey</h1>
      <p>Wakey is an iOS app <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paomartcard/">Pao</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowan-mockler-198218128/">Rowan</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebhs/">Seb</a> built that first began in Stanford's CS377U class (Understanding Users). In this class, teams identify a domain of interest wherein they perform comprehensive research (reviewing scholarly articles, evaluating existing services/platforms, and interviewing users) to identify user pain points, ultimately developing an MVP as their proposed solution that they test, analyze, and iterate upon.</p>
      <p>In the wake of Stanford students being displaced across different timezones as a result of COVID-19, our team investigated the domain we dubbed, 'Connecting from a distance', looking to better understand and leverage the social mechanics of successfully cultivating long-distance friendships. Through our research, we found that historically, when socializing online from a distance, there is often little middle ground between losing all contact with a social tie, and remaining in close, consistent contact. As a result, oftentimes our weaker ties, together with a facet of those we would ordinarily consider close ties, fall by the wayside. Additionally, when exploring why existing social platforms aren't solving this problem, we were led to believe that current methods of establishing initial communication require 'heavy', very intentional social interactions that discourage many social first-moves.</p>
      <p>It was this insight that inspired the conceptualization of Wakey, a social alarm app that allows users to 1) have their morning alarm consist of short voice notes from their friends, and 2) help curate the alarm their friends wake up to. On Wakey, sending a Wakey message (a voice note) is quick, easy, personal (or not - it's up to you!), and purposefully asynchronous. In this way, Wakey provides a convenient means of friendship cultivation while also removing the social burden of initiating communication with friends (by doing away with 'heavy' social  first-moves).</p> 
      <p>We have continued the development of the Wakey app beyond college. Learn more and join the waitlist by accessing out <a href="http://wakey.me/">website</a> and keep an eye out for our launch on the App Store at the end of August!</p>
